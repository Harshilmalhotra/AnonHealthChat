# Anon Health Chat : Bridging Confidential Conversations in Web3

## Our Inspiration:-
In conventional healthcare systems, patients often face barriers to open communication due to concerns about privacy, leading to hesitancy in expressing sensitive health issues. Recognizing the need for a more confidential and secure platform, our project aims to develop a Web3-based chat application named AnonHealthChat. This platform addresses the challenge of fostering open dialogue between patients and doctors, enabling individuals to freely discuss their health concerns without fear of judgment or embarrassment. The project seeks to leverage decentralized technologies to ensure enhanced anonymity and privacy, revolutionizing the way healthcare conversations are conducted in the digital age.

## What it does:-
Patients can purchase time slots from the app either by paying using cryptocurrency or usual modes of online payment systems. After purchase an account-id and key will be given to patients, they caninteract with doctor peacefully without feeling insecure since it supports end-to-end encryption since its built using blockchain technology and on top of **Polygon Dapp**.

## Challenges we ran into
So, first challenge we ran into was running smart contract file on vs code. We tried may vs extensions, saw tutorials on youtube and chat gpt -ing we found out  a solution that we should run our smart contract file on https://remix.ethereum.org/ then fetch an api key for the smart contract and put that that key into our chat application.




## What's next for Decentralized chat application
On top of this application we can invoke various features like secured patient record sharing as it a confidential information that should not be leaked out.
